1)Put the biscuit crumbs in your bowl, then tip in the melted butter and mix it all together.
2)Spoon this into the base and press against the bottom and sides – this is the base of the banoffee pie recipe. 
3)Chill it for ten minutes.
4)Melt the butter and sugar into a non-stick saucepan over a low heat, stirring all the time until the sugar has dissolved.
5)Add the condensed milk and bring to a rapid boil for about a minute, stirring all the time for a thick golden caramel.
6)Spread the caramel over the base, cool and then chill for about 1 hour, until firm or until ready to serve.
7)Carefully lift the pie from the tin and place on a serving plate.
8)Slice the bananas; fold half of them into the softly whipped cream and spoon over the base.
9)Decorate with the remaining bananas and finish with the grated chocolate.
