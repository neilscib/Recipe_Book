Pizza Norma Recipe:

Pizza dough, room temperature
Marinara
Eggplants, 2 medium, cut into 1″ cubes
Garlic, 1 clove, minced
2 tsp olive oil
1 tsp salt
Fresh basil
Ricotta salata, shredded
Mozzarella, shredded


Stretch the pizza dough to the desired size and thickness and place on a sheet pan.  If you have a baking stone, put the pizza dough on a thin layer of cormeal on the back of a sheet pan to make the transfer easier.  Top with marinara, eggplant mixture, fresh basil and cheeses.  Put the pizza in the oven (or transfer to the baking stone).  Bake until the crust is fully cooked, about 20 minutes unless you have a smokin’ hot oven.
