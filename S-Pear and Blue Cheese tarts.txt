1)Preheat the oven to 200°C/fan180°C/gas 6. Roll the pastry into a 30 x 20cm rectangle.
2)Cut in half lengthways, then make 2 cuts widthways, to give 6 equal squares. 
3)Brush each square with the egg and score a square inside the pastry, leaving a 1cm border. Bake for 10-12 minutes.
4)Using a spoon, lift out and discard the inner square of pastry, and scoop out any uncooked pastry.
5)Heat the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat. When melted, fry the onion until slightly browned.
6)Mix the onion, Cambozola, pear, cream, thyme and seasoning.
7)Fill each pastry square with a generous tablespoon of the filling and bake for a further 5 minutes.
8)Mix the walnut oil and lemon juice and toss with the salad and walnuts.
