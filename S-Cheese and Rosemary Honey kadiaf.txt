Starter Ingredients Cheese and rosemary honey pie:

60g unsalted butter, plus extra to grease
250g kataifi/kadaif pastry 
200g feta, crumbled
100g halloumi, grated
125g ball mozzarella (not buffalo), shredded
100g clear honey
4 fresh rosemary sprigs, plus 2 to serve
Squeezed lemon juice
Aleppo chilli flakes to garnish

Method:
1)Grease the cake tin well with butter, then set aside and heat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7. 
2)Put the kataifi in a food processor and whizz until you have strands that are 1-2cm long. 
3)Melt the 60g butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat then, when foaming, tip in the pastry. 
4)Stir to coat it in the butter, then cook for a few minutes, stirring often, until the pastry has become a little translucent and has changed colour slightly. 
5)Tip about two thirds of the pastry into the cake tin and spread it over the base, pressing it up the sides, creating a hollow in the centre. 
6)Mix all the cheeses together and season well with black pepper. 
7)Press the mix into the hollow, then put the remaining pastry over the top and pat it down to secure it. 
8)Bake for 25-30 minutes until the pastry is deep golden and crisp. 
9)Meanwhile, put the honey, rosemary sprigs and lemon juice into a small saucepan and heat gently until the honey is very runny – but don’t let it boil. 
10)Leave it to cool while the pie finishes cooking.
11)Once the pie is ready, remove from the oven and carefully invert onto a serving plate (hold the plate on top of the pie, smoothly flip the pie and plate together in one move, then remove the cake tin base). Heat the honey again until runny, then drizzle it over the pie to soak in. Top with rosemary sprigs, scatter with aleppo chilli, then slice and serve while still warm. A sharp, heavy knife is best for cutting.
